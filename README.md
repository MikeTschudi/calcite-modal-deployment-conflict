#### solution-deployment-app doesn't display calcite-modals correctly

On Androids and in Google Chrome's mobile emulator set for a mobile display, a calcite-modal is wider than the screen.  

Examples:
* modalE9d2.html has a modal that is wider than the screen
* modalE9d3.html has a modal that fits the screen

The difference between the two is that modalE9d2 has a modal atop a "gallery" containing an image that's 400px wide, while modalE9d3's gallery's image is only 200px wide.
